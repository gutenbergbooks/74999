<p class="in4">In requesting the honour of
dedicating to you the following pages, I am
actuated by the feelings of respect and personal
regard, which I entertain equally for
your public and for your private character.</p>

<p>It is also with more than ordinary interest
that I address my observations to you, as
the President of the College; an office
which, it may with truth be said, you fill
with no less dignity to yourself, than with
benefit to the whole profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>In becoming an advocate for the employment
of the stethoscope, I disclaim
adopting principles in the practice of physic,
which might with any justice be called
mechanical.</p>

<p>It cannot however be denied, that with
all the improvements which the art of medicine
has received, it still must, on many
occasions, depend greatly on conjecture.</p>

<p>Some of the diseases of the chest are
attended with such obscurity, that the detection
of their precise nature bids defiance
to the most acute penetration. What prudent
physician, then, will disdain to avail
himself of the means which this simple but
philosophical instrument affords, of obtaining
a more faithful diagnosis?</p>

<p>It is not intended that its use should supersede
those established principles of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
art, which early and regular education, as
well as experience, have pointed out to us;
but that it should serve as an auxiliary in
the investigation of obscure disease.</p>

<p>For my own part, I have no apprehension
that the judicious employment of the
stethoscope can, in any degree, tend to
make us negligent in observing the symptoms
of diseases, or indifferent to the study
of the usual means of diagnosis.</p>

<p>In the hope, that the general opinions
which I have offered in this volume, may
receive the high sanction of your approval,</p>

<p class="right">

<span class="lsp1">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<hr class="r10">
</div>


<p>Having expressed my opinion generally
on the merits of the stethoscope, in
the course of the following Essay, I have
little to say in the form of a preface.</p>

<p>Although the credit of the invention is
due to the ingenuity of M. Laennec alone,
and the volume which he has presented to
us abounds with valuable pathology, it is
of no small importance that the sentiments
and the experience of others should also be
collected and recorded.</p>

<p>Before any new method in the practice
of medicine can be firmly established, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
even deserve to be regarded in the light of
fixed authority, it is incumbent upon us to
examine all the collateral evidence which
can be produced in its favour; and he who,
with this view, contributes to the general
stock of information, may claim the merit
of usefulness, although he be not entitled to
the more brilliant distinction awarded to
genius.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that whoever adopts
the use of the stethoscope, must study it
for himself, and consider, that all which is
offered to his attention by the industry
and observations of others, is calculated to
serve his purpose only as an introductory
lesson.</p>

<p>The skilful employment of this instrument
must be the result of practice. Every
case which occurs, presents new and distinct
matter for investigation. It is peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
necessary to be accurate in marking
with nicety the nature of the impressions
which are made upon the ear, and to reflect
upon the phenomena with all the
skill and care of the physiologist, the
anatomist, and the physician. Nothing
must be left to the imagination; for, if this
creative faculty be exercised, the judgment
may be misled, rather than informed and
assisted.</p>

<p>I have purposely confined myself to a
limited sketch of the general subjects
which I have embraced; so that if the
following pages should not appear to possess
the merit of great novelty, they will,
I hope, at least escape the imputation of
being tedious and devoid of interest.</p>

<span class="lsp1">OBSERVATIONS,</span><br>
<br>

</div>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In a late visit to Paris, I availed myself
of the opportunity of attending the principal
hospitals; of inquiring into the general
practice of French medicine; and of studying,
at the hospital of La Charité, the
method brought to so much perfection by
M. Laennec, of investigating the diseases of
the chest; in regard to which, I had also the
advantage of receiving every kind attention
and personal instruction from this distinguished
physician.</p>

<p>The method of which I now purpose to
offer a brief account, embraces the use of
percussion and of the stethoscope.</p>

<p>It appears that percussion was first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
practised by Avenbrugger in Germany, who
published a treatise on the subject in the
year 1761, which was translated into
French by the celebrated Corvisart, with
commentaries, in 1808. This author, in his
Treatise on the Diseases of the Heart, constantly
founds much of his diagnosis on the
indications afforded by percussion.</p>

<p>The method consists in striking the respective
parts of the chest, which return a
hollow kind of sound, when the contents of
this cavity are in a healthy state; but give
a duller sound, when, from any cause, there
is impediment to the free entrance of air
into the cells of the lungs. When the
obstruction is considerable, the perception
is very much the same as when you strike
upon the thigh. The sound is flat instead
of hollow.</p>

<p>Simple as it may appear, there is a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
tact in the mode of percussing;
and it is of importance to practise it in aid
of the information derived from the stethoscope.</p>

<p>The linen covering over the chest may
remain, but thick dress should be removed,
and the surface also ought to be smooth.
The integuments should be rendered rather
tense by the favourable position of the arms.
The four fingers being held close, bent, and
a little curved, the chest is to be struck
rather sharply and in quick succession; and
when the indication of obstruction is manifest
by the dulness of sound, the corresponding
part on the opposite side, is to be struck
with equal force; nice care being observed
that all circumstances are equal; as for example,
the kind and strength of percussion,
the quantity of covering on the part, and the
position of the patient. At small points of
examination, it will sometimes be convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
to use, in the same manner, only two
fingers; or, now and then, on a broad surface,
the flat hand, percussing rather slowly
and gently.</p>

<p>M. Laennec displays no less skill and
accuracy in his mode of percussion than in
the use of his stethoscope; and he attaches
great importance to it as an auxiliary source
of information.</p>

<p>Through the industry and ability of Dr.
Forbes of Chichester, who translated the
work of Laennec in 1821, and who has also
lately published an original volume of great
merit on the subject; and through the medium
of our medical journals, more especially
the excellent quarterly works published
at Edinburgh by Dr. Duncan, jun.,
and in London by Dr. James Johnson, the
professional public has been made acquainted
with the nature and uses of the stethoscope;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
but up to the present time, it is so
much a novelty in medical practice, as
well as with the public at large, that I
trust no apology is necessary for presenting
an abridgment of the opinions of
M. Laennec, with a few reflections on the
subject derived from my own observation
and practice.</p>

<p>As with percussion, the use of the stethoscope
is founded upon a simple philosophical
principle; that of ascertaining whether
the cells of the lungs are healthy, and
fitted for the free reception of air in the function
of respiration; or whether the membranes
of the chest, or the vessels, valves,
and cavities of the heart, are obstructed by
any disordered action, or by any permanent
disease.</p>

<p>The instrument which has received the
name of <em>stethoscope</em> (derived from στῆθος,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
pectus, and σκοπέω, speculor or exploro), was
invented by M. Laennec; and the idea
of it occurred to him from reflecting on the
well-known fact in acoustics, that the impression
of sound is augmented, when conveyed
through certain solid bodies, as, when
we hear the scratch of a pin at one end of a
piece of wood, on applying our ear to the
other. In examining a disease of the heart,
he first made use of a quire of paper rolled
into a cylindrical form, and, satisfied with
the result, he soon proceeded to investigate
the various phenomena afforded by the vibrations
of air within the chest, through the
medium of the stethoscope; which he constructed
from the suggestion already mentioned.</p>

<p>After making various experiments as to
the form of the instrument, and the kind of
material, he found most success in using a
wood of medium density, as cedar. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
proves very favourable for conveying the
delicate vibrations caused by respiration,
from the walls of the chest to the ear. For
the information of those who have never
seen the instrument, I may observe, that it
is of cylindrical form, shorter in length,
but larger in diameter, than the common
flute. It has a cylindrical perforation
throughout its whole length, and is divided
into two parts for the convenience of using
the whole or half length, according to the
situation of the patient in bed. The end of
each part terminates in a funnel-shaped
cavity, the one to receive the separate half
of the instrument, and the other to receive
the part acting as a stopper, which latter
has a short pipe, made of brass or silver to
enter the bore of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The instrument is used without the
stopper, when employed to ascertain the
state of respiration; and with it, either to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
examine the action of the heart, or the signs
afforded by the voice, in certain states of
disease affecting the lungs, or the pleural
membrane.</p>

<p>In using the stethoscope, care is to be
taken that it is kept perfectly flat upon the
part to which it is applied, in order that
sound may not escape, nor air be admitted;
for which purpose it is convenient to
hold it at its lower part, while the other
end (with the even surface) should be in
close contact with the ear, so that the aperture
of the instrument be in direct communication
with the internal ear. Silk covering,
as causing a creaking sort of noise, and
thick dress, as obscuring the sound of respiration,
should be removed; but the linen
or flannel dress may remain on the person
without disadvantage. A beginner will be
very apt to fail in his early trials, from inattention
to some of these points, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the difficulty which at first attends the
tuition of the ear.</p>

<p>A skilful use of the instrument requires
much practice. It is not, as some may imagine,
a simple matter of hearing a delicate
sound. <em>Tact</em> is necessary, but this will be
acquired by perseverance. For two days
of my own study, I was frequently at a loss
to distinguish the peculiar sound or murmur
of respiration, and almost despaired of success.
I mention this circumstance, that
others beginning with the practice of this instrument,
may not be deterred from proceeding,
by the awkwardness and disappointment
which they at first encounter.</p>

<p>At <i lang="fr">La Charité</i>, the best informed students
are great enthusiasts in the practice of
this discovery, and regard it as an indispensable
source of information in the diagnosis of
the diseases of the chest. Such reliance on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the stethoscope is very natural, when constant
proofs are afforded of the accuracy of
opinion formed by M. Laennec, and others,
who are competent in using it. The proofs of
sure diagnosis are derived from dissection; as,
necessarily, the diseases of the lungs and of
the heart, allow frequent opportunity of obtaining
this test of the physicians’ judgment.</p>

<p>I will relate one instance which came
within my immediate knowledge; although
equally strong proofs are so numerous, that
the regular observer can no more doubt the
merits of the stethoscope, than the mathematician
can distrust a resolved problem.</p>

<p>In the clinical record of a case of consumption,
M. Laennec had stated his opinion,
that the upper portion of one lung was
the exclusive seat of ulceration. The patient
died, and examination was made.
The lungs were removed from the chest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and the expected evidence of disease did
not appear. M. Laennec, making a closer
inspection, discovered that a small part of
the upper lobe had been left in the chest,
and upon its removal, the ulceration was
found exactly as he had predicted.</p>

<p>Some persons assert, that the discovery
of the precise situation of an ulceration of
the lung is merely a matter of curiosity, as
when arising from tubercles, they consider it
incurable; but surely this is not a good medical
objection. Our art may improve so
as to enable us to remedy these evils; and
assuredly our chance of success will be increased
by a knowledge of the seat of
tubercles, their commencement, and their
progress. While those persons therefore
who have made use of the stethoscope with
success, praise it in terms which may seem
romantic and beyond the truth; others, and
perhaps those chiefly who have never even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
seen the instrument, speak of it with ridicule,
or censure it as a piece of quackery.</p>

<p>It is not just that any one wholly unacquainted
with the stethoscope, should
assume the right of pronouncing an opinion
on its properties. It certainly does not deserve
the imputation of quackery; for this
opprobrium belongs to the concealment of
a remedy; or to some mysterious plan of
practice, studiously kept secret for the mere
purpose of gain. Candour is most honourable
to the educated mind; and to be
sensible of our ignorance on any particular
subject, is the first step to the acquirement
of knowledge.</p>

<p>It has been said that the use of the stethoscope
may be injurious, by leading the
physician to know too much of the danger
in a bad case; to make him despond and
resign the patient to his fate too soon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Such an observation scarcely requires refutation.
In no instance of dangerous disease
can the physician see his way too
clearly; and at all times to know the disease,
is at least making a considerable approach
towards the cure. The judgment,
the discretion, and the humanity of the
good physician, will be a sure protection
to the patient against any abrupt decision,
any gloomy opinion, and much more against
unkind desertion, in the most hopeless circumstances
of disease.</p>

<p>The following case serves to shew the
converse proposition, and the happy purpose
to which superior knowledge and discernment
were applied.</p>

<p>M. Laennec was consulted in the case of
a gentleman who was supposed to be dying
from phthisis pulmonalis, and in a state so
desperate, that he was not expected by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
medical attendant to survive more than two
or three days.</p>

<p>M. Laennec made his usual investigation,
and persuaded himself that the case had
been mistaken, and that the alarming symptoms
did not arise from ulceration of the
lungs, but from empyema, or purulent collection
within the pleuræ. He strongly
recommended that the operation for this
disease should be performed; and, after a
little hesitation and delay, his advice was
adopted. A large quantity of pus was
evacuated, and immediate relief was afforded.
The amendment was rapid, and
the progress of cure so favourable, that the
gentleman recovered his health in less than
three months.</p>

<p>In thus rendering my homage to the
merits and science of M. Laennec, I do not
wish it to be thought, that I consider even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
his authority as infallible; but it is nothing
more than is justly due to the new practice,
to admit, that it may become of very great
importance; and, that by no other mode can
we examine the interior state of the chest,
with equal accuracy.</p>

<p>Let it be further remarked, that we are
not required to lay aside any of our ordinary
methods of investigation: This additional
mode comes to our aid in cases of obscurity
and difficulty. If the physician of long experience
be so confident in his powers of
diagnosis, that he rejects this invention as
unnecessary for his purpose, it need not follow
that he should disapprove of it for others
who are less experienced, and are more diffident
of their skill and penetration. Most assuredly
it is a great help to the judgment;
and I am fully persuaded, that, in proportion
as it is understood, it will be more generally
received, and more highly esteemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>If the naked ear be applied to any part
of the chest, it is made sensible of the entrance
of the air into the cells of the lungs;
and the beginner in this study will receive
the impression more fully and sensibly, than
by the medium of the stethoscope, because
the vibrations are collected from a larger
surface; but it is a less accurate method, and
much less analytical. He may with advantage
practise with the naked ear occasionally,
in order to become familiar with
the sounds of respiration; but under many
circumstances, such a mode is inconvenient
and inapplicable. The listening by the ear
only is technically called, immediate auscultation;
and by the stethoscope, mediate
auscultation.</p>

<p>In examining the chest of a person
whose respiration is calm, we should desire
that it be made purposely quicker, and
stronger; but not so audibly as to cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
confusion by that external sound. The
perception afforded to the auscultator by
healthy lungs, is that of air entering a
cavity, as it were with a gentle stream of
sound. If the pupil first apply his naked
ear to the chest, he will have a clear idea
of what he has to expect. As a general rule,
in making our investigation of the state of the
lungs, the stethoscope should be applied immediately
under the clavicle, near the axilla;
and the learner will do well to choose the
right side, lest he become confused by the
action of the heart. In seeking for ordinary
respiration, it should not be applied near
the trachea, as the stronger action of the
air in the bronchial tubes would mislead
the ear. To ascertain the state of the posterior
part of the lungs, the instrument is to
be applied on the scapula, above or below
the spinous process.</p>

<p>In my own practice, I have derived the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
utmost advantage from the use of the stethoscope
in cases of pneumonia, with regard to
local treatment. When we find a patient ill
with severe symptoms arising from inflammation
of the lungs, we do not require the aid
of auscultation to determine us in employing
the lancet as our first and most important
remedy; but we may desire immediately
to join with the general bleeding, local
depletion; and, most commonly, the period
arrives when we wish to use local treatment
exclusively, by cupping or leeches,
and blisters. Under such circumstances, it
is of the utmost importance that we should
be able to ascertain the exact seat of the
inflammation; and when, as commonly
happens in pneumonia, the patient cannot
direct us by any sensation of pain, but is
labouring under a general sense of oppression
and suffocation; we resort to the stethoscope
as a positive and most valuable
source of instruction. Even when it is manifested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
to us by ordinary indications, that
the inflammatory action is prevailing on
one side of the chest, it is of great advantage
that we can detect, by means of the
instrument, the particular part of the lungs
most affected. I shall illustrate the truth
of these remarks by the recital of a few
cases.</p>

<p>A gentleman dangerously ill with inflammation
of the lungs, which had supervened
on an attack of asthma, experienced,
in the evening, a renewal of the
feelings of suffocation, which, in the morning
had been relieved by copious bleeding
from the arm. In the middle of the upper
part of the chest, he had a severe sensation
of tightness, but was not conscious that the
lungs were affected more on one side than
the other. His cough was most urgent. The
stethoscope, applied to the lower part of the
right side, conveyed to the ear a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
sonorous rattle, both on inspiration and expiration,
much resembling the sounds of
loud snoring. These sounds could not be
detected in any other part of the chest. In
addition, therefore, to a fresh bleeding from
the arm, cupping was used very freely at
this part, and with evident good effect.
Almost immediately the sounds abated.
Two days after, leeches and a large blister
were used with further benefit; and the
actual relief of the patient perfectly corresponded
with the improving indications afforded
by the stethoscope. Occasional
bleedings from the arm were afterwards required;
but the inflammation was finally subdued,
and the constitution was restored to its
previous state; this gentleman being habitually
subject to spasmodic asthma.</p>

<p>A female patient was in a state of most
alarming difficulty of breathing from neglected
inflammation of the bronchiæ, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
had extended to the lungs. The pulse was
sharp and frequent, the skin hot, and every
urgent symptom of high fever and irritation
was present. Her cough was extremely
violent, and the expectoration difficult. The
expectorated matter was dense and almost
puriform in appearance. On applying the
stethoscope over the upper part of the
right side of the chest, at every point, and
also over the whole of the right shoulder
blade, I heard acute sounds similar to those
produced by air strongly passing through a
key-hole. I considered that these sounds
indicated active inflammation in the whole
ramifications of the bronchiæ of the right
lung. A large quantity of blood was drawn
from the right arm; and cupping was also
freely employed, both on the chest and
shoulder blade. A saline draught with
tartar emetic and nitre was administered
every two hours. I need not detail the
exact progress of the case. These principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
of treatment being diligently followed
up, the patient finally recovered.</p>

<p>A gentleman, subject to gout, took cold
in the month of January from exposure to
wet. He nursed himself, but not aware of
the seriousness of his attack, had neglected
to procure medical advice. I found him
affected with advanced symptoms of inflammation
of the lungs; and, without delay,
directed a copious bleeding from the
arm. There was very great irritation in
the stomach and bowels, attended with painful
diarrhœa; on which account, twenty
leeches were applied to the middle of the
abdomen. His cough was sharp and violent.
The appearance of the blood indicated
high inflammatory action, being
cupped so as to form almost a round ball.
The surface of the blood was covered with
a thick buffy (fibrinous) coat, and the
serum was very abundant, being pressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and, as it were, squeezed out from the coagulum
in the firmness of its contraction.
The indication by the stethoscope on the
left side, was that of the “râle crépitante,”
or the rattle, which is compared to the
crackling sound of salt when thrown upon
hot iron, and serving to shew that inflammation
was existing in the texture composing
the air cells. Similar indications were presented
on the right side, but in a slighter
degree. The patient did not complain of
pain in any part of the chest, but suffered
severely from oppression, having the feeling
that “the room was too small to
breathe in.”</p>

<p>By means of repeated bleedings, blistering,
and the use of suitable medicines,
the urgent symptoms were removed, and
the patient in a short time enjoyed the first
feelings of convalescence. The weather
suddenly became intensely severe, and, probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
from an injudicious change of apartment,
a relapse of the symptoms of violent
cough, difficulty of breathing, fever and
general irritation, immediately took place.</p>

<p>Now, by means of the stethoscope, I
distinguished to a considerable extent at the
upper part of the left side of the chest, a
mixed rattle, composed of sounds rather
deep than acute, and a gurgling noise, as if a
large quantity of mucus was floating in the
cells. At the shoulder blade, the instrument
furnished the same signs. In addition
to the repetition of bleeding from the arm,
twenty ounces of blood were removed by
cupping, part from the breast and part from
the shoulder blade. Great and immediate
relief was afforded. The general fever, of
which, both now and before, occasional delirium
was one symptom, was checked.</p>

<p>The medicine consisted of tartarized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
antimony and nitre in a saline draught, with
the addition of syrup of poppy, in order to
quiet cough and irritation. On the following
day, blood was again taken from the
arm freely; but, notwithstanding the blood
exhibited the same signs as before in a
great degree, no further depletion was
required.</p>

<p>We are much instructed as to the degree
of inflammatory action of the vessels by
the appearance of the blood, which, when
possessing these characters, is commonly,
but inaccurately called inflamed. And we
must not consider that continued bleeding
is the indispensable remedy for restoring
the circulation to a healthy state, and the
blood to its natural condition. My view of
the nature of blood of this description is,
that it simply contains a larger proportion
than usual of one of its constituent parts,
termed the fibrin; and hence, a firmer clot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and the buffy coat. It is important as being
an attendant on inflammatory action<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and
an indication, therefore, to our treatment.
Although we rightly attach all possible importance
to the use of the lancet, and of local
bleeding, we must not forget that we have
other means of reducing the circulation; as,
for example, the use of medicines, repose,
and general regimen.</p>

<p>To return to the case, I have to add,
that when heat of the skin and general
fever were abated, the peculiar sounds just
now mentioned, had also nearly disappeared.
In this state of improvement, a large blister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
was applied over the affected side of
the chest. As it seemed probable that
further general bleeding might be avoided,
digitalis was added to the medicine. This
becomes a valuable agent at the period
when we may hope to have laid aside the
use of the lancet. If employed during the
height of inflammation, most probably it
will not render the pulse slower; and even
if it <a id="tn_27">does</a> have this effect, it rather masks than
cures the disease, leaving us in doubt whether
the abatement of the pulse be fairly due to the
diminution of inflammatory action, or to the
influence of the digitalis. This gentleman
recovered gradually, but in the most favourable
manner.</p>

<p>The latest morbid indication by the stethoscope,
was simply the mucous rattle.</p>

<p>In exploring the state of the chest with
the stethoscope, it is incumbent upon us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
reason carefully upon every phenomenon
which we discover, and not to consider this
or that circumstance as merely curious.
We should weigh well the importance of
the pathological indications; and form our
conclusions, in great measure, from our
knowledge of the anatomical structure of
the particular parts of the organ which we
find to be affected; and, also, from the relative
situation of one part to another. For
example, we discover different kinds of rattle,
accordingly as the bronchial tubes, or the
air cells, may be respectively affected; and
the effect produced on the action of the
heart by a morbid condensation of the
left lung, is very different from that occasioned
by the same state of disease in
the right.</p>

<p>In cases of pulmonary consumption, it
is important for us to ascertain whether or
not ulceration has yet taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>In this investigation, we use the stethoscope
with its stopper, as serving better to
bring the sound of the voice to a focus. If
there be an open tubercle (in synonymous
terms, ulceration, or excavation), the vibrations
produced by the voice passing more
readily to the ear of the auscultator, than
when there is no breach of surface in the
lung, it seems as if the patient were speaking
up the tube, and hence the exact situation
of the ulceration is indicated. This
phenomenon is called by the expressive
term, pectoriloquism.</p>

<p>If the instrument be applied over the
windpipe, when there is not disease, the
voice produces in some measure the same
effect; because at this part, the integuments
are thin, and do not interpose much medium
between the voice of the person speaking,
and the ear of the auscultator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>It is a consoling circumstance that M.
Laennec does not view tubercular consumption
as an incurable disease. He mentions
having several patients under his care ill
with chronic catarrh, affording distinctly
the sign of pectoriloquism, although in all
other respects then free from symptoms of
consumption.</p>

<p>He refers to the case of a lady, a patient
of M. Bayle, in whom pectoriloquism was
quite distinct. She had been decidedly
affected with the symptoms of consumption
eight years before: she had recovered beyond
all expectation, and was then stout,
not having any other symptom of pulmonary
irritation than a slight cough.</p>

<p>M. Laennec next relates<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the morbid
appearances in the lungs, found on dissection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in five cases of patients who died from
other diseases. In each instance, tubercular
excavations were found cicatrized, and for
the most part lined by a semi-cartilaginous
membrane; adding testimony therefore
to the opinion already stated, that nature
does sometimes exert a curative process, in
cases of consumption which were apparently
hopeless.</p>

<p>It should consequently be the study of
our art to favour the salutary efforts of
nature; and invariably to cherish and encourage,
in a judicious manner, those hopes
of the patient, which in this destructive disease
are always, to a remarkable degree,
so fondly entertained. It is to be observed
that if a solid cicatrix be formed, and
the bronchial tubes terminating in the part
be obliterated, the phenomenon of pectoriloquism
cannot be found; but we meet
with it in two states of the diseased lung,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the one in which the ulcerative process is at
present going on; the other, in which there
is a healed excavation or ulcer, lined by a
newly-formed membrane, of a semi-cartilaginous
nature, and fistulous. These respective
conditions will of course be denoted
by the relative state of the patient.
The perfect cicatrix is more completely a
curative process, than the formation of
fistula.</p>

<p>The recovery of health from the cure of
ulceration just described, may prove more
or less lasting accordingly as the remaining
part of the lung be free, or not, from
tubercles. But even when they do exist,
they may fortunately remain dormant for
some years.</p>

<p>In every case of seeming recovery from
consumption, it is incumbent on the patient
to lead a life of the utmost care, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
choose a favourable climate, endeavouring
to avoid the cold of winter, the extreme heat
of summer, and the vicissitudes of spring
and of the latter part of autumn, by the
best possible management. M. Laennec is
particularly partial to a sea-side residence
for consumptive patients.</p>

<p>In some circumstances of consumption,
the existence of pectoriloquism, as
denoting the ulcerative process, is considered
by this physician to be rather favourable
than otherwise; because it is an
indication that nature is making efforts
towards a cure, by maturing and evacuating
the tuberculous matter. The prognosis
is favourable in proportion as we have reason
to hope that the other parts of the lungs
are healthy.</p>

<p>In some severe examples, numerous
tubercles acquire an active state of disease;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and the consequent irritation is so excessive,
that death takes place without the usual
process of ulceration.</p>

<p>The nature of the expectoration will
guide us considerably in our diagnosis; but
it is necessary to keep in recollection, that
it should never be judged of separately from
the other symptoms. It frequently happens
that we witness the sputa of ill appearance
and puriform, without danger in
the patient; in so great a degree does the
bronchial membrane, in common with the
other mucous membranes, fall into a state
of irritation and diseased action, which alters
the secreting function most remarkably; and,
as a consequence, we find the product similar
in appearance to that which the vessels
form, when there is actual breach of
surface.</p>

<p>M. Laennec observes, “that the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
lobes of the lungs are the most common
seat of tuberculous ulceration; but that they
also occur in the centre of the lungs; in their
anterior, middle, or lateral parts, or even in
their inferior edge, while the superior lobes
are uninjured.”</p>

<p>In a case in which we suspect pectoriloquism,
we must therefore make our investigation
sufficiently extensive.</p>

<p>Also, in a suspicious case, we are not to
form a decision upon a single examination;
“because the sputa contained in the excavations
may obstruct for a time the communication
with the bronchiæ, and thus suspend
pectoriloquism for several hours.” M.
Laennec further observes, “If, after repeated
trials, we cannot discover pectoriloquism,
we must infer, either that the tubercles
are still immature, or, if softened, that
they do not communicate with the bronchiæ;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
or, lastly, that the disease is not
phthisis.”</p>

<p>In cases of pleurisy, when there is serous
effusion between the layers of the
pleuræ, the voice affects the stethoscope so
as to produce that peculiar phenomenon of
bleating sound, to which the term <em>œgophonism</em>,
or <em>caprine pectoriloquism</em>, is given;
from the supposed resemblance to the voice
of a goat. M. Laennec considers that “the
natural resonance of the voice in the bronchial
tubes is rendered more distinct by the
compression of the pulmonary tissue, and
by its transmission through the medium of
a thin layer of fluid.”</p>

<p>I have traced, in a case of pleurisy, the
daily diminution of this phenomenon, in
proportion as the absorption has taken
place, and the healthy condition of the
pleural membrane has returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>I should add to this concise account,
that M. Laennec considers œgophonism to
be a favourable sign in pleurisy; because it
indicates a moderate degree of effusion. It
is not found, “if there have been a rapid
and copious effusion, by which the lung
becomes suddenly compressed against the
mediastinum; nor where a former attack
of the disease has firmly attached the posterior
parts of the lung to the pleuræ.”</p>

<p>Four principal kinds of rale or rattle are
enumerated, as discovered by the stethoscope.
They are termed, “the humid or crepitous;
the mucous or guggling; the dry sonorous,
and the dry sibilous or hissing rattle.” Other
characteristic varieties might be mentioned.
For the physical explanation of these phenomena
we must refer to the altered condition
of the air cells, the bronchial tubes, or the <a id="tn_37">pleural</a>
membrane, occasioned by inflammation
and its consequences; or, sometimes by spasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
only as regards the bronchiæ. For many details
on this part of the subject, the reader is
referred to M. Laennec’s Treatise by Forbes.</p>

<p>In the case of an elderly lady, ill with
pneumonia and bronchitis mixed, I distinguished,
on the right side, immediately
under the clavicle, the râle crépitante; but,
rather lower down, sounds like the chirping
of a bird, an effect probably owing to spasmodic
contraction of the minute branches of
the bronchia, arising from inflammation.
The other side of the chest afforded indications
of free but noisy respiration. In addition
to general bleeding, twelve leeches of
full size were applied to the right side with
great advantage. On the following day,
the chirping sounds were lessened, and afterwards
yielded entirely to further general
and local bleeding. Instead of the chirping
sound, we sometimes find that which is aptly
compared to the cooing of the turtle dove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>It is certain that the diseases of the heart
form a much more delicate and difficult
study with the stethoscope, than those of
the lungs.</p>

<p>In our ordinary means of investigation,
it often exceeds our best powers of discrimination,
to distinguish satisfactorily between
functional and structural disease; and
this difficulty, I apprehend, will not be
removed by the use of the stethoscope,
although I am well persuaded it will be
very materially lessened. Both humanity
towards the patient, and a regard for our
own reputation, demand that we should use
very great caution in forming our opinion
on these occasions, and still greater in pronouncing
it.</p>

<p>Inordinate action of the heart arises
from many influential causes, both of a
moral and physical nature. Nervous palpitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
is of common occurrence. Intermission
of pulse is not unfrequent; but I have
had occasion to see most experienced practitioners
mistaken concerning the true nature
of this affection. It occurs as a sympathy
with a morbid state of the brain, the stomach,
and also the liver; but most frequently,
according to my observation, when the
stomach of an individual of nervous constitution
is disordered with permanent indigestion.</p>

<p>The most remarkable cases of intermittent
pulse which have occurred in my practice,
have been connected with faulty action
of the digestive organs, and of the liver especially,
in gouty persons. We know how
remarkably the gout affects the nervous
system; and I can scarcely offer a stronger
proof of it, than this kind of influence upon
the heart; for although we meet with examples
of the same kind of irregular action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
in a disordered state of the digestive organs,
in persons free from all disposition to gout,
yet in such instances it is neither so permanent
nor so remarkable.</p>

<p>I was consulted by a gentleman ill with
gout, who related to me that, a few years
before, he had been troubled with intermittent
pulse for the long space of four
years; and, during this period, his mind was
alarmed with many gloomy apprehensions.
His digestive organs were much disordered:
medicine had given only partial relief.
Quite suddenly, a painful and regular fit of
gout took place, for the first time. Immediately
the action of the heart became regular,
and has so continued from that period.</p>

<p>I have met with similar instances less
strongly marked.</p>

<p>In various affections of the heart, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
also of the aorta, I have derived very useful
information, and practical instruction, from
the employment of the stethoscope. In
the case of a female, the instrument, applied
to the epigastric region, conveyed to the ear
the peculiar sound which is compared to
the blast of a pair of bellows strongly used,
and which was attended with occasional
pain, especially after taking food. The repeated
application of leeches, with the use of
sedative medicine, afforded permanent relief.</p>

<p>When we consider that, from the examination
of the pulse at the wrist, we obtain
information only of the action of the left
ventricle of the heart, and that by means
of the stethoscope we are made acquainted
with the action of both ventricles and both
auricles, the value of the instrument must
appear unquestionable.</p>

<p>This fact, that the pulse at the wrist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
does not indicate the state of the whole
heart, is important in a practical as well
as a physiological point of view. The
pulse, in certain diseases, may be weak and
small, when the action of the heart is energetic,
and which is to be ascertained by the
stethoscope. On the other hand, there may
be more energy in the action of the pulse
than in the heart generally. The practitioner
will receive very material instruction
with regard to the use of the lancet,
in these indications; and will know with
more accuracy when he should prefer local
to general bleeding.</p>

<p>In the first trials with the stethoscope, it
is extremely difficult to distinguish the action
of the ventricle from that of the auricle; and
this confusion is greater if the heart be acting
with more than ordinary frequency.</p>

<p>The motions of the left cavities of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
heart are chiefly perceptible in the space
comprised between the cartilages of the
fifth and seventh ribs; and of the right, at
about the middle of the sternum, or sometimes
rather lower.</p>

<p>With the stethoscope, we first distinguish
the action of the ventricles, which
occurs at the same moment with the beat
of the pulse at the wrist. It is accompanied
by a rather dull, but distinct sound. Immediately
after, and without any interval,
the contraction of the auricles takes place,
attended with a noise which M. Laennec
compares to that of the lapping of a dog.
The duration of this sound, and consequently
the period of the contraction of the auricles,
is less than that of the ventricles.
Next, there is a very short, yet well-marked,
interval of repose.</p>

<p>The regularity of this order will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
variously disturbed, by the sympathy which
the heart observes towards other organs, as
I have already explained; but much more
materially by changes taking place in its
own structure.</p>

<p>The sounds occasioned by the action of
the heart, or of the large arteries, when
disordered, are remarkably characteristic in
their nature, and, if well understood, assist
in a very satisfactory manner, our diagnosis,
pathology, and treatment.</p>

<p>The Treatise of M. Laennec, and the
late original publication by Dr. Forbes,
furnish us with much valuable information
for the diagnostic use of the stethoscope in
diseases of the heart. A new volume which
is about to issue from the press, to be presented
to us by the Master of this art, M.
Laennec, will contain the important results
of his later experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>As, in a diseased condition of the lungs,
when the symptoms are more serious in
appearance than reality, we can obtain the
comfort to the patient and ourselves, of
giving a favourable prognosis by means of
the stethoscope; so, in the disordered action
of the heart, it may often be in our
power to gain that clear perception of the
case, which may arm us with confidence as
to its true nature, and its freedom from
danger, and thus enable us to dismiss much
of the apprehension, with which the nervous
mind of the patient is sure to be distressed.</p>

<p>Having thus brought in view an outline
of the general merits of the stethoscope<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
and of the improved method of exploring
the diseases of the chest, I proceed to the
remainder of my subject; it being my purpose
to discuss, in a brief manner, some
leading points of theory and practice suggested
to my consideration by the cases and
facts which came under my notice at the
hospitals in Paris; and also to offer a few
observations on the most important new
medicines which may be considered of
French origin.</p>

</div>


<p>Hospitals, and hospices, are numerous
in Paris. The latter establishments are for
the reception of the aged and infirm, or
foundlings. Some of the hospitals are general
in their principle of administration;
while others are appropriated to particular
age, or sex, or disease.</p>

<p>A board of general administration is
held daily for the purpose of examining the
patients who apply for admission. By
means of this arrangement, the physician of
any hospital whose attention is directed to
a particular disease, or class of diseases,
may send a patient to the hospital to which
he is attached. The attention of the medical
officers of the different hospitals is highly
laudable, and worthy of imitation. They
make their visits of regular attendance in
the wards daily, and usually at the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
hour of seven, and deliver clinical lectures
on the most interesting cases at nine. I
was present at these lectures, both at the
Hotel Dieu and at La Charité, and was
much gratified with the ability displayed by
M. Dupuytren at the former, and by M.
Laennec at the latter hospital.</p>

<p>In most of these abodes of suffering, the
sisters of charity exercise the kind office of
superintending nurses, in which capacity,
however, their humanity leads them to perform
various active duties. It is quite delightful
to witness the benevolence of their disposition,
and the tender manner in which they
pay their attentions to those under their
pious care. How happily is the influence
of religion here displayed, which can thus
temper the mind to forego the pleasures of
society, and even the common enjoyments
of life, for a retirement, in which every
hour and almost every moment, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
thought and action, become a homage to
the Creator, in the alleviation of human
suffering!</p>

<p>There is an establishment in Paris
which contributes exceedingly to the comfort
and convenience of that class of persons
who wish to avoid a hospital, but whose
means are too limited to afford all the private
aids which sickness requires<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. I quote
the following account of it from Galignani’s
Guide to Paris.</p>

<p>That a material difference exists between
the French and English practice of
medicine, is universally known; and the
compliment of superiority is seldom allowed
to the former. Improvement, however, in
the art of medicine, which the successful
cultivation of chemistry and of morbid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
anatomy has so largely introduced in the
last twenty years, is not confined to ourselves.
The professors of chemistry at
Paris receive their appointments and their
conveniences from the government. That
valuable commodity, time, is much at their
command, because they confine their pursuits
more than most of those who are
engaged in teaching chemistry in London.
The facility of procuring, at Paris, the
examination of dead bodies is such as to
favour the study of morbid anatomy most
completely.</p>

<p>The general objection amongst the
French to the use of calomel prevails almost
as strongly as at former periods; and certainly
amounts to a prejudice. I learnt, on
good authority, at Paris, that this medicine is
usually found to act in a peculiar manner
on the constitution of the French patient;
as it commonly produces irritation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
intestinal canal to a degree that causes extreme
discomfort. I need not relate with
what freedom and satisfaction the English
make use of this active medicine.</p>

<p>I apprehend that the difference of
operation is to be ascribed chiefly to the
respective nature of the diet in the two
countries. The remark applies most particularly
to the free use of light wines,
amongst the French. The vin ordinaire
must produce very different effects from the
English malt liquor; or the use of plain
or soda water, in conjunction with wines of
more sound quality. Indeed the difference
of regimen appears to me a sufficient explanation.
I may here remark how very materially
the action of mercurial medicine on
the bowels is controuled by suitable preparation
of the patient with mild mucilaginous
drinks. If, on the contrary, the
stomach and intestinal canal be charged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
with acescent liquor, vinous, or of any
other kind, acescent food, and fresh fruits,
irritation and disorder, more or less painful,
may be expected as almost a certain consequence.</p>

<p>If the French employ calomel or other
preparations of mercury too little, we doubtless
run into the opposite error, of using
them too much. It calls for the gravest
censure, that, in almost every nursery, calomel
should still be administered by the
parent to young children and even infants,
with as little consideration as if it were a
simple domestic medicine. I am convinced
that the infantile constitution is frequently
most sensibly injured by so erroneous a
practice, and that the scrophulous disposition,
which might otherwise be dormant,
is thus called into action at an early period
of life. I think it ought to be an established
rule, that mercurial medicine should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
administered to young children without the
sanction of medical authority.</p>

<p>I wish, however, to be understood, that
in speaking of the employment of calomel
generally, I censure its abuse only. The
proper use of it deserves our confidence and
best regard; and I think that the French
physician labours under great disadvantage
in not having a just practical acquaintance
with the virtues of this excellent medicine,
which, as a remedy in various kinds of
active disease, is without a rival.</p>

<p>Chiefly on the principle of avoiding the
frequent use of internal medicine, it is a
custom universal among the French to assist
the bowels by lavement; which, under
circumstances of disease, is variously medicated,
but otherwise consists merely of
water or gruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>As an occasional remedy, this practice
is most useful and important; and, in certain
cases of great delicacy of constitution,
it may be a very advisable substitute for
aperient medicine, however regularly it may
be required: but under ordinary circumstances,
as a habit, it appears to me as objectionable
in other respects as it is inconvenient.
When the bowel becomes much
accustomed to this artificial distension, it
often fails to act without receiving such
solicitation; and hence a mechanical necessity
is established for this peculiar stimulus<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57-58]</span></p>

<p>When the digestive powers of the
stomach are unhealthy, and particularly
when the functions of the duodenum and
of the liver are also in error, as we usually
see in established disorder of the chylopoetic
viscera, the propagated influence which
may take place from the lower bowel
being stimulated to discharge its contents
by means of the lavement, is insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
to remedy the functional error existing so
much higher up in the canal, and I have
witnessed examples in which serious complaint
in the liver has made insidious progress,
from the circumstance of the patient
having placed reliance on this palliative
relief, and neglected the employment of an
effective course of medicine.</p>

<p>The application of leeches, with a view
to derive blood from the vessels which communicate
with those of the lower bowels,
is a practice quite common in France, and
seems a favourite measure, whatever viscus
of the body may be affected. I have no
doubt of the utility of this mode of obtaining
blood, when the lower part of the intestinal
canal is in a state of congestion;
and, I may add, in many cases of irritation.
A gentleman had been troubled with
diarrhœa, which was often painful, for
two or three months. It had resisted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
usual treatment by medicine. By one application
of leeches near the rectum he was
cured.</p>

<p>Nature often points out the propriety of
relieving the overloaded circulation of the
intestines, by the discharge of blood from
the hemorrhoidal vessels, and when, therefore,
the indications for such a mode of evacuation
are presented, without any spontaneous
relief having taken place, the use of
leeches is important. Also in certain states
of congestion of the uterine vessels, this
method of local depletion will be attended
with advantage.</p>

<p>In all cases of inflammation near the
surface, in which the detraction of blood is
proper, the application of leeches is a very
eligible mode of treatment. I apprehend
that blood is drawn from a greater number
of capillary vessels by this method than by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
any other; such abstraction being favoured
also by the gradual and protracted evacuation
of the vessels. It remarkably relieves inflammatory
action, either of the acute or
chronic kind, in the stomach and bowels.
It is by no means so effectual in maladies
of the head and chest, in which cupping
is a better mode of taking away blood;
although occasionally, even in those complaints,
the use of leeches may be more
convenient, and even more appropriate.</p>

<p>Comparatively speaking, the practice
of taking away blood by cupping is very
rarely resorted to by the French, and they
appear to prefer, in principle, the mode of
bleeding by leeches, which they call derivative;
thus for the relief of the head, they
apply them in the neighbourhood of the
rectum. That free cupping at the neck or
behind the ears, or opening the jugular vein
when the vessels of the head are in a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of congestion and increased action, is a far
more efficacious treatment, appears to me
most unquestionable.</p>

<p>I consider it to be an important principle
of treatment in regard to the detraction
of blood, in local inflammation,
that we should make it from the system,
when the action of the heart is much
increased beyond the natural standard.
When we have sufficiently reduced the pulse,
or, if in the first instance the general circulation
do not appear to be affected, it may be
preferable to use cupping or leeches only.</p>

<p>In active inflammation of any of the
important organs of the body, the <em>decided</em>
conduct of the English practitioner in using
the lancet as his chief remedy, promptly
and boldly, and persisting till the dangerous
force of the disease is conquered, demands,
in my opinion, an undoubted preference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
over the more tardy, and I must add, the
inefficient methods of the French. This
leading difference in the method of treating
dangerous inflammations, appears to me to
constitute the most remarkable distinction
in the practice of the English and the French
physician.</p>

<p>I believe that severe and dangerous diseases
are much less frequent amongst the
French than the English. There are physical
and moral causes to explain this fact.
Their climate is less variable, and less humid,
than ours. They use a lighter diet;
much more bodily exercise, and they are
a more cheerful people, constantly cultivating
amusement. Hence, probably, the general
plan of French practice is simple; and
the use of <i lang="fr">tisanes</i> and <i lang="la">lavemens emolliens</i>
is generally preferred to the employment
of active medicines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The pharmacien is not in any case permitted
to prescribe; and no one can open a
shop for the sale and preparation of medicines,
without the permission of the authorities.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">La médecine expectante</i> is still the favourite
method of practice with many of
the French physicians. I cannot undertake
to say how generally. When the
principle is directed by a clear judgment,
there is much in it to be admired. A constant
and too officious interference by means
of active medicines, may do serious injury
to the powers of the constitution; and, on
such terms, the remedy may be worse than
the disease: but, on the other hand, to
look on passively as a spectator, and witness
the formation of disease, forbearing all active
treatment until formidable symptoms
take place, seems more reprehensible even
than excess of zeal in the use of medicine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
I approve the maxim, <i lang="la">Venienti occurrite
morbo</i>.</p>

<p>In inflammations of the most important
organs of the body, if we allow delay, or
want decision, the moment of being useful
soon passes away. It is incumbent upon
us always to pay due attention to natural
indications, and to consider nature in the
light of a good physician; but I maintain
that, in all instances of acute disease, and
for the most part in chronic, we may interpose
our aid with certain benefit, if we form
a correct diagnosis, and come armed with
just principles of practice.</p>

<p>Within the last few years, new medical
doctrines<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> have been introduced in France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
by M. Broussais, Professor at the Hôpital du
Val-de-Grâce at Paris; of which, the most
important part relates to the inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the alimentary
canal. This inflammation is divided into
acute and chronic, and is denominated according
to its situation; <em>gastrite</em>, when
affecting the stomach; <em>gastro-enterite</em>,
when it extends from the stomach to the
small intestines; and <em>colite</em>, when confined
to the colon.</p>

<p>The great importance of the functions
of the stomach and intestines, and the active
sympathies which the stomach especially
exchanges with every part of the body,
almost as a centre of the nervous system, is
one of the medical truths first taught in our
schools, and is constantly demonstrated to
our observation, both in health and sickness.
But M. Broussais has extended to an
unauthorized length, his theories founded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
on the inflammatory affection of the mucous
membrane of the digestive canal; so
that, if I mistake not, he assigns to it almost
an universality of influence.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance with the <em>gastro-enterite</em>,
is a key to the whole pathology of
this Professor, who has taken a great lead
in Paris, and formed a school of his peculiar
doctrines. He considers that all the essential
fevers of authors are only various forms
of sympathetic phenomena, arising out of a
gastro-enterite; that all the pretended nervous
affections of the stomach are the result
of a chronic gastrite; that the various dangerous
disorders of the brain, for the most
part, owe their origin to the state of the
digestive passages, irritated with chronic
disease; that in all the febrile phlegmasiæ,
the stomach and small intestines are irritated
in the commencement, if not during
the whole progress of the malady; that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
gout depends commonly on a chronic
<em>gastro-enterite</em>, “which prepares and supports
the irritation of the joints.”</p>

<p>He considers that <em>gastrite</em> rarely exists
alone, and that it is almost constantly joined
with an inflammation of the small intestines.</p>

<p>He does not admit that there is any
essential difference in the nature of gout
and rheumatism.</p>

<p>This is a very concise epitome of the
doctrines of M. Broussais, and is offered
only as an outline.</p>

<p>The practice which is founded on this
view of most of the diseases of the body is
remarkably simple, and may be almost included
in the free and repeated application
of leeches to the most affected part of the
abdomen; the use of fomentations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
poultices to the seat of irritation; of emollient
lavemens; of tisanes calculated to
allay irritation; of the mildest nutriment,
as veal broth with rice; also the greatest
care is used to avoid every irritating material,
whether medicinal or dietetic; and, to
favour all these means by entire repose and
time. The gravest fevers of the East and of
the West; the plague itself; the fevers of
our own country, continued or intermittent,
typhoid or inflammatory, and the phlegmasiæ,
appear to be all arranged under
the same general principle of treatment.</p>

<p>From the observations which I had the
opportunity of making at the hospitals in
Paris, and from the attention I have since
devoted to the examination of these doctrines,
I am far more inclined to borrow,
occasionally, from the opinions of M.
Broussais, than implicitly to follow his
theory or practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>I am persuaded that the idea of inflammation
of the mucous membrane, founded
on the morbid appearance of the tongue,
and a dry and heated state of the surface
of the body, is often too strongly entertained.
When the tongue is wholly red
and dry, or red in part, with whitish or
yellow fur on its edge, the inference may be
fairly drawn, that the digestive organs are
in a morbid condition, and which is further
shewn by the loss of appetite, and by the
state of unnatural thirst. I admit also that
in these circumstances, there is a great
susceptibility to inflammatory action in the
mucous membrane of the stomach and
small intestines; and the knowledge of this
fact should make us extremely careful in
the employment of any heating stimulus,
medicinal or dietetic, in the treatment of
fevers, or of the phlegmasiæ. I am also
aware, that, in many cases of fever, terminating
fatally, the morbid appearances on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
dissection will be found chiefly in the mucous
membrane of the alimentary canal,
but also in the mucous membrane of the
bronchiæ; thus lending great support to
the doctrines of M. Broussais. On the
other hand, I have had occasion to notice
deductions, in my opinion, too hastily drawn
to be correct, from the mere appearance of
redness here and there in the stomach and
intestines, presenting to the zealous admirers
of the doctrine in question, the full
evidence of gastro-enterite. Respecting the
precise interpretation due to such appearances
on dissection, the best anatomists and
pathologists will sometimes differ. I may
here remark, that the inspection is now and
then made too hastily and superficially:
it is requisite that the state of the whole
canal should be accurately traced. In the
first view of the parts it may happen that
scarcely any morbid appearance is discovered;
but on extending the research, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the ulcerative process may be met with in
patches: at La Charité I saw several examples
exactly in point.</p>

<p>That an inflammatory state of the mucous
digestive membrane is very influential
upon the functions of the other organs,
and of the brain especially, is unquestionable;
but is it primary or consequential, in
the order of occurrence? In reference to
the question of continued fever, I apprehend
that it is an effect, and not the primary
cause of the general disease, which
attacks the whole nervous system at once,
afterwards producing disorder in parts of
the body which are most predisposed to
morbid action; and, certainly, it appears
that such secondary disease most commonly
falls upon the mucous membrane of the alimentary
canal, and also on the bronchial
membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>If in the outset of these observations I
may seem to contradict my concluding remarks,
I wish it to be understood that I
admit the partial, but not the total, fitness
of the doctrines in question. I object still
more to the rigid practice which is enjoined
of avoiding the use of purgative medicine,
when the appearances of the tongue are
such as I have described, notwithstanding
that the patient may be free from nausea,
or from tenderness or pain of the stomach
or bowels. I consider that the preference
is greatly due to our English practice of
giving occasional doses of calomel, or some
mercurial alterative, in combination with
suitable purgatives, by means of which the
vitiated secretions, always a source of irritation,
are removed. But here again, I admit
that we should look watchfully to the symptoms
which may indicate the necessity or
the propriety of applying, with freedom,
leeches to the <a id="tn_73">epigastric region</a>, and subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
fomentations, for the relief of inflammatory
action, and of using purgative
medicine, in such circumstances, with proportionate
caution.</p>

<p>As a general statement, I would assert,
that in the commencement of fever, continued,
intermittent, or remittent, the action
of an emetic, and of calomel joined with
purgative medicine, is most beneficial and
important; and the fear of producing <em>gastro-enterite</em>
by such measures, would lead
us into the serious error of <em>omission</em>.</p>

<p>In cases of confirmed indigestion, our
improved modern pathology leads us to the
employment of those means which remove
inflammatory irritation; as, the application
of leeches, and other local remedies; the
use of mild corrective medicines, abstinence
from food, which calls the digestive powers
into much action, and general regimen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
We avoid using bitters and stimulants to
provoke that appetite which nature has
so wisely denied during the irritation of
disease.</p>

<p>In active inflammation of the intestines,
existing in conjunction with their obstruction,
it must be our first care to remove the
inflammatory action by general and local
bleedings, and to refrain from the use of
purgative medicines by the mouth, till this
first object is accomplished, in case that
such medicine causes sickness and vomiting,
and evidently aggravates irritation.
I do not doubt that much mischief is often
produced by the solicitude of the practitioner
to remove obstructed action of the
bowels, instead of directing his treatment
to the removal of inflammation, as the immediate
and primary object to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>I will here take occasion to offer a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
remarks on the subject of Gout and Rheumatism.
The theoretical opinions advanced
by M. Goupil to prove the identity of the
two diseases, are to me quite unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Gout never assails the husbandman who
unites temperance with his labours; but he
is not exempted from rheumatism in any
of its forms. Gout is the disorder of peculiar
constitutions, and of the adult age; but
rheumatism occurs at every period of life,
and to all constitutions.</p>

<p>On the assumption that gout is a <em>gastro-enterite</em>,
with a developement of irritation
in the joints, purgative medicines
are prohibited, and the free application
of leeches to the affected parts is recommended
as the chief curative treatment.</p>

<p>I admit that in some circumstances of
the gouty paroxysm, the mucous digestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
membrane is affected with inflammatory
irritation, requiring suitable and peculiar
treatment; but, as a general principle of
practice, I confidently advocate the use of
alteratives and purgatives, and, with only
occasional exceptions, disapprove of the
employment of leeches as a remedy for the
local part of the disease.</p>

<p>As in theory, so in practice, I believe
that M. Broussais considers that rheumatism
is to be viewed in the same light as the
gout.</p>

<p>M. Laennec employs general bleeding in
acute rheumatism; leeches in the chronic;
and tartar emetic in both forms of the
disorder.</p>

<p>An analytical examination of the points
of doctrine and practice, which I have here
briefly discussed, would lead me far beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the limits which I have intended to observe
in this Essay; but I could not overlook
the most interesting novelty which
has, for the last five years, engaged the
French school of medicine.</p>

<p>It is still a custom amongst the French
physicians to employ <i lang="fr">tisanes</i>, which are
decoctions or infusions of roots, herbs,
flowers, or grains, as medicinal remedies
on which they seem to place considerable
reliance. The “<i lang="fr">formulaire pratique
des Hôpitaux civils de Paris</i>” contains
nearly ninety prescriptions of different
kinds of tisane. With us, the Lisbon diet
drink, or the simple decoction of sarsaparilla,
is the only medicine which we direct
to be taken in quantity as a drink. But
even sarsaparilla is given with more advantage,
in a state of concentration, by using
the cortical part of the root, exclusively, in
which the whole virtue seems to reside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>I object to the general principle of using
medicine in a state of large dilution. It is
true that the French do not prescribe active
substances in this form; but their fondness
for these feeble agents, tends to establish
inefficient and almost insignificant practice.</p>

<p>Diluent drinks are useful adjuncts to
medicine; but I should think that a very
limited number of tisanes would comprise
all that can be considered either as useful
or agreeable.</p>

<p>The nurse may safely act the part of
the pharmacien in this department, but, at
the same time, should be directed by the
physician as to the preparation of suitable
drinks. With this qualification, the attention
of the French physician in nicely regulating
the regimen of the sick chamber,
is worthy of our imitation. The effect of
the most useful and appropriate medicines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
will often be frustrated, unless a corresponding
care in the plan of diet be strictly
observed.</p>

<p>To this mode of practical medicine peculiar
to the French, which I have here
criticised as not worthy of the skilful physician,
there are some striking exceptions.</p>

<p>At the excellent Hospital St. Louis,
chiefly appropriated to the treatment of the
various diseases of the skin, and principally
under the direction of Alibert and Biett,
arsenical and other active preparations are
administered without apprehension. They
prefer small doses of arsenical solution,
twice a-day for a continuance, to the use of
large doses for a short time. Tincture of
cantharides, in the dose of twenty drops
twice a-day, is one of their favourite remedies,
alternately with arsenic, in the
treatment of the order Squamæ. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
employing such medicines, however, they
are careful to remove all inflammatory action
from the system.</p>

<p>Subcarbonate of ammonia, dissolved in
water, in the proportion of two drams to
a pint and a half, and given in this quantity
daily, is found useful in certain states of
cutaneous irritation, apparently caused by a
free employment of mercury for syphilis.</p>

<p>The inveterate disease called <em>lupus</em> is
very successfully treated by the application
of an arsenical caustic. They allow the
part to form a crust, before they apply a
poultice or any emollient dressing.</p>

<p>Neither expence nor trouble is spared
in making the artificial medicated baths.
The alkaline bath, prepared by dissolving
the subcarbonate of soda in the proportion
of two pounds to the necessary quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
water, is extremely useful when the skin is
affected with scales.</p>

<p>The douche de vapeur affords great benefit
in some obstinate local affections of
the skin, when it is necessary to stimulate
the vessels so as to bring about an entire
change of action. This description of
douche often proves useful in chronic rheumatism,
and in sciatica, when existing in
the chronic form.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity of witnessing the
administration of tartar emetic in large doses,
as a daily medicine, to patients under the
care of M. Laennec. His method is to begin
with one, two, or four grains, as the total
quantity for the twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>A solution is made in the proportion of
half or the whole of a grain, to half an ounce
of simple or some lightly aromatic water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
sweetened; and it is given every two hours.
The patient is desired to drink very sparingly;
for without this caution, the medicine
would most probably produce too much
of emetic effect. In the first instance, this
result very commonly happens; but it is
remarkable how soon the stomach accommodates
itself to large doses of this active
medicine. When its continued use produces
sickness, syrup of white poppy is added, in
the proportion of an ounce to half a pint of
the antimonial solution; or, as an equivalent,
a grain of extract of opium. The total
quantity of the tartar emetic is very commonly
increased to twenty grains and upwards
in the twenty-four hours. I saw an
elderly man, who had, in this space of time,
on the preceding day, taken sixty grains
without having experienced nausea, or any
other inconvenience.</p>

<p>M. Laennec considers that the tartar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
emetic, when administered with the freedom
which I have described, exerts a
highly useful power in diminishing inflammatory
action in continued fever, and in
the phlegmasiæ; and he is most satisfied
with its action, when, after the first day
or two, it ceases to produce any sensible
effect on the stomach.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the extraordinary circumstance
of the exhibition of this active medicine
in such immense quantity with seeming
impunity, I thought it probable that the
French preparation might be weaker than
our own; but on comparing the crystals
which I procured at Paris, with those prepared
according to the London Pharmacopœia,
I could not discover any difference; nor
is there the least essential distinction in the
mode of preparation, as directed by the
London Pharmacopœia and the French codex.
I have lately had many opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of prescribing tartar emetic on the principle
of treatment which I have described; and I
have been perfectly satisfied with its useful
agency; but I have usually commenced
with one grain, and never exceeded two
grains, for the first twenty-four hours; nor
found it necessary to go beyond eight in
the progressive quantity; except in one
case of insanity, in which sixteen grains
were given daily for a short time, with
the greatest advantage. In the quantity of
two grains, it has usually produced considerable
sickness for the first day or two;
but afterwards, even the increased doses
have seldom caused any nausea.</p>

<p>With some persons, however, the first
dose of a quarter of a grain produces active
sickness. It appears to me probable that the
maximum of usefulness<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is to be found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
a moderate range of doses; and that it is
desirable to avoid trying how much the
stomach and the constitution will possibly
bear. Have we a security that the accumulation
of a very large quantity might
not produce violent effects? Indeed, I
am informed of an instance in which
the amount of sixty grains was taken in
divided doses in a short time; the direction
being given that the medicine should be
repeated till vomiting was produced. At
length, such severe sickness did take place,
as could not be restrained for many weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>In the treatment of active inflammation,
I have usually joined nitre in moderate
doses, with tartarized antimony, in a saline
draught; and when the inflammatory action
has so far yielded, that I have had
confidence in not requiring the further use
of the lancet, and therefore not apprehended
the inconvenience to which I have
adverted at page 27, of disguising the disease,
I have added digitalis to the draught
occasionally; thus obtaining a combination
of sedative medicines of great efficacy;
and, according to my experience, not disagreeing
with the stomach during the active
state of the disease.</p>

<p>We must always keep in mind that the
effect of medicine is in the greatest degree
relative to the particular disease for which
it is administered, and to the force of such
disease. The doses of active medicines are
to be diminished as symptoms abate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>In the case of a gentleman suffering
from enlargement of the liver, and with
whom mercury in any form acted very unfavourably,
I obtained the most satisfactory
results from the use of tartar emetic as an
alterative; this medicine never occasioning
that nervous irritation which invariably attended
the use either of calomel or the
pilula hydrargyri.</p>

<p>The practice which I have here related,
of administering large doses of tartar emetic,
and that recommended by Dr. Hamilton,
of the free use of purgatives, appear very
opposite to the doctrines of Broussais, which
inculcate such a tender regard to the susceptibility
of the stomach and intestinal canal,
as almost to discountenance the use of emetics
and purgatives, from the apprehension
of producing <em>gastrite</em>, or <em>gastro-enterite</em>.</p>

<p>We are greatly indebted to the ingenuity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and industry of the French chemists
for many important results in vegetable
chemistry; and as the most valuable of all
the discoveries made, I may mention the
separation of the essential principle of the
yellow bark (cinchona cordifolia) called
<em>quinine</em>; which, for medical use, is afterwards
combined with sulphuric acid, forming
the now well-known medicine, sulphate
of quinine<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>I do not consider it to be proved, that
the sulphate of quinine embraces all the
useful qualities of the entire bark; although,
from its power in curing intermittent fever,
we may conclude that it possesses the most
important. Two of the principles which
are removed by the process for obtaining
the sulphate, namely, the quinic acid, and
resin, must not be disregarded.</p>

<p>I have sometimes found the decoction of
bark more acceptable to the stomach, and
more useful, than the sulphate of quinine,
and particularly grateful when given with
the carbonate of potash and lemon juice in
effervescence, adding also some tincture and
syrup of orange peel.</p>

<p>Bark in substance very often oppresses
the stomach, and seems to impair both
the appetite and digestion, which in
general become improved by the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
of the sulphate of quinine. Indeed, formerly,
when in the habit of directing large
and frequent doses of the powder of bark
for the cure of ague, I found it expedient
almost to forbid food, seeing that the stomach
was sufficiently occupied with the presence
of the bark. It is scarcely necessary
to observe, that, in some cases of ague,
where the digestive organs, and the liver
especially, are in fault, bark, in any form, is
not the appropriate medicine for the cure.</p>

<p>The sulphate of quinine is unquestionably
a powerful and excellent tonic, and at
the same time does not stimulate unfavourably.
I am accustomed to prescribe it with
great success to patients convalescent from
gout; to whom on all former occasions,
bark in its other forms had proved unsuitable,
tending to re-excite the gouty action.</p>

<p>The acetate of morphine is another of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the new medicines derived from the French
chemists, which we can administer advantageously
to those individuals who are too
much stimulated by the ordinary preparations
of opium. The process<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> employed
for the separation of morphine from opium,
removes the resin, the narcotine, and meconic
acid.</p>

<p>The black or Lancastrian drop owes its
useful quality to the circumstance of its
containing a larger proportion of acetate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
of morphine than the other principles of
opium; but it is not so pure a preparation
as the acetate of <a id="tn_93">morphine</a>, prepared as I
have described.</p>

<p>It appears to me that half a grain of
the acetate of morphine is about equal to a
grain of the extract of opium.</p>

<p>When immediate relief from severe
pain is sought to be obtained, and that
opium does not materially disagree with the
patient, a preference is due to the tincture
of opium, as being a more powerful anodyne
than any of the other preparations
which I have mentioned. I have found, by
experiment, that the resin, separated from
the other parts of opium, has an anodyne
power, not inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The hydrocyanic (prussic) acid is a valuable
medicine, but requires, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
my observation, more care in the administration
of full doses, than any other medicine.
It may be given in small doses,
usually, without any inconvenience. When
its qualities were first proclaimed, it was too
highly extolled as a remedy in phthisis pulmonalis;
and, from consequent disappointment,
I conceive that its just merits are not
sufficiently appreciated. In some cases of
hectic fever, attended with urgent cough,
I have procured the happiest effects from
the use of this medicine. I have not, with
the adult patient, in any instance, prescribed
more than twenty-four minims as
the total quantity, in twenty-four hours;
and usually have confined myself to the
extent of fifteen, always commencing with
small doses.</p>

<p>In order that this medicine may be
given with reliance on its properties, it is
necessary that it should be kept in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
dark, in a cool situation, and that the vial
should be accurately stopped. I proceed to
offer a cursory account of several of the
other new medicines.</p>

<p>The alcoholic extract of nux vomica
exerts a special and powerful influence
on the spinal marrow, and has produced
very beneficial effects in some urgent cases
of paralysis. It may be given either in
general or local palsy, provided that inflammatory
action be not present; that
there be no indications threatening apoplexy;
and that due care be taken in its
administration.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the beneficial effects
of the medicine in very confirmed cases
of paralysis, we are informed by M. Magendie,
that the paralytic limbs should experience
some convulsive action; and this,
he says, usually takes place in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
of a few days. Then the dose of the medicine
is to be lessened. It is administered
with most advantage in the form of a pill.
A quarter of a grain is the least dose which
need be used in the beginning for an adult;
and it may be given twice or thrice in the
day. The dose is to be increased according
to its effects: and it is stated by M.
Magendie, that some persons have borne
the augmented quantity of thirty grains in
the day: but from four to six grains per
diem, is the maximum amount usually
required. This distinguished physiologist
mentions that, in Italy, the following tincture
is very much employed for the treatment
of paralytic limbs, by means of friction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent fs80">Alcohol, one ounce,<br>
Dry extract of nux vomica, three grains.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Edwards, at Paris, was successful
with nux vomica in a case of amaurosis, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
gutta serena, accompanied with a paralysis
of the upper eye-lid. It has afforded great
benefit in many cases of local paralysis,
affecting different parts of the body in
different examples.</p>

<p>A medical friend informs me, that he
obtained very great advantage from this
medicine in the treatment of a severe case
of tic douloureux, after various other medicines
had failed to give relief.</p>

<p>In a case of long standing paralysis of
one of the lower extremities, I have had great
cause to be gratified with the useful agency
of the alcoholic extract, in relieving the
symptoms of neuralgia. The patient, a
gentleman between thirty and forty years
of age, had been afflicted with occasional
pains of great severity coming on suddenly,
causing complete disability, lasting about
twelve hours, and during such period, producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
exquisite tenderness of the limb.
With the abatement of pain, sleep followed;
and, on awaking, this tenderness
had so completely passed away, that he
could bear a free handling of the parts;
but the muscular power of the limb was
weakened during the day, it was frequently
affected with convulsive action, and its
usual debility became much increased.</p>

<p>The case is in progress; but up to the
present time the medicine has evidently
produced good effects, and without causing
any tetanic action of the muscles, which
I have mentioned as being considered desirable
in some cases; although an unusual
sense of tightness was produced. Not the
least pain has returned, and the limb is
stronger. When I had increased the dose
to a grain and a quarter during two days,
the sense of tightness, joined with much
feeling of weight, became troublesome, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
suspended the use of the extract. In forty-eight
hours these symptoms disappeared,
and the medicine has been resumed without
any kind of disagreement. I may add, with
satisfaction, that the retentive power of the
bladder, which had been for a long time
affected, became materially improved.</p>

<p>It has been discovered by M. M. Pelletier
and Caventou, that the nux vomica,
the bean of St. Ignatius, and the upas poison,
owe their active power over man and
animals, to two particular vegetable alkalies,
the strychnine and brucine.</p>

<p><em>Strychnine</em> is procured in the state of
crystals, by a complicated chemical process,
from the nux vomica. Its action on the
animal economy, as proved by experiments
on dogs, is so extremely powerful, that one
would conceive it to be inadmissible as a
medicine; but M. Magendie relates that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
has administered it in paralytic cases with
good effects. From an eighth to a quarter
of a grain is the usual dose. Brucine has been
found combined with strychnine in the nux
vomica. In St. Ignatius’s bean, and in the
upas, brucine bears a similar relation to that
which cinchonine has to quinine in the cinchona
barks, the strongest of which (cinchona
cordifolia) contains the largest relative
proportion of quinine. In the same
manner the bean and upas, which are much
more active substances than the nux vomica,
contain little of the brucine, and much of
strychnine. In the upas, strychnine is almost
pure<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>For medicinal purpose, brucine is procured
from “la fausse angusture” (angustura
ferruginea). The process is in most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
respects similar to that employed for strychnine.
It is administered in pills, and has
been employed in paralytic cases with reported
success by M. Magendie, and by M.
Andrals fils, in doses from half a grain to
five grains; and it is assuredly a much
safer preparation than strychnine.</p>

<p>The active properties of ipecacuanha
have been found by M. M. Magendie and
Pelletier, to reside in an immediate principle
which they have called <em>emetine</em>. They
consider that it may be advantageously
substituted for ipecacuanha, as an emetic, it
being divested of the offensive odour and
taste of that substance, and which M. Caventou
found by experiment to be foreign
to the emetic qualities of the medicine. As
an emetic, from a quarter to a whole grain
in solution may be first given, and a quarter
or half a grain repeated every twenty
minutes till the due effect be produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p><em>Veratrine</em> is an alkali procured by a
long chemical process from the plants of
the family of veratrum. It appears to be
the chief active principle residing in the
colchicum autumnale, and in white hellebore.
M. Magendie states that the dose of
a quarter of a grain usually affects the intestinal
canal rather powerfully. In a case
of apoplexy, he prescribed two grains in
the twenty-four hours without producing
much effect on the bowels. He comments
on this result, as proving how much the
state of the nervous system influences the
action of medicines.</p>

<p>M. Magendie suggests that the use of
veratrine might be preferable to the tincture
of colchicum and the eau médicinale
(which latter medicine he considers to
be substantially veratrine), on account
of the greater uniformity of the preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>In the treatment of gout, I am induced
to avoid the active preparations of colchicum
entirely; and in employing the acetum
colchici, which is very mild, I use it only
in combination with other medicines, and
desire to procure from its agency rather an
auxiliary operation, than that of colchicum
distinctly. I have endeavoured to explain
my sentiments fully on the subject in my
Treatise on Gout and the disordered State
of the Digestive Organs.</p>

<p>With these observations, I shall now
conclude my summary view of the nature
of the principal new medicines, which have
been added to our list of remedies by the
science and industry of our continental
neighbours<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>It would lead to an interesting field of
inquiry, were we to examine the general
customs and the habits of living in different
countries, in relation to health; and to trace
the influence of climate, soil, political and
civil institutions, laws, religion, &amp;c. But
the subject would demand a volume, rather
than a few pages, and be foreign to my
present limited purpose.</p>

<p>According to what I have learned from
others, and from my own personal observation,
I should state that the diseases which
arise from repletion, as apoplexy and gout,
occur more frequently in this country than
in France. I am persuaded also, that the
latter disease has increased amongst the
middle classes of society in this country,
with the progress of luxury and refinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>The quantity of solid meat consumed
at the English table, and the use of heavy
malt liquors, together with strong wines
not sparingly taken, may be contrasted
with the extenuated dishes of the French,
and their beverage of lemonade, vin ordinaire,
and weak though grateful wines.</p>

<p>I am aware that the French generally
eat a greater variety, and take a larger
quantity of food than the English; but
their meats are stewed, their soups are
not heavy, and their vegetables are well
dressed. Oil is a plentiful ingredient in
many of their dishes, and they scarcely use
spices. Altogether their food appears calculated
to pass the digestive organs readily;
and when the nature of the liquors and
some other circumstances are considered,
the total regimen is not, I apprehend, so
much suited to produce repletion and its
evils, as that commonly pursued in this
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>In London, the extreme lateness of the
hours both for dining and evening amusement
is obviously unfavourable to the constitution.
In Paris, fashion in this respect
is more rational; and the custom of remaining
a short time at the dinner table, after
the repast, and the period of conviviality
consequently being abridged, much difference
of result must follow in regard to the
health of the inhabitants of these great cities.
The French people are far less inclined to
be sedentary than the English, and appear
to be active and cheerful both by nature
and habit. I conclude, therefore, from these
and other causes which might be mentioned,
that the medical system of practice must,
of necessity, vary considerably in the two
countries.</p>

<p>Paris is altogether less humid than London;
and the superior clearness of its
atmosphere is in great measure to be attributed
to the use of wood fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>A general notion is entertained that
the water of Paris is deleterious to strangers,
as producing disorder of the stomach and
bowels. Not denying the fact of such indisposition
occurring to those who visit
Paris for a short time, I may still question
the nature of the cause.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have examined the filtered<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> water of
the Seine, and obtained the following results:</p>

<p>Its specific gravity is 1.0002.</p>

<p>Solution of muriate of barytes added to
the water produces an immediate but slight
milkiness.</p>

<p>Oxalate of ammonia causes, in a few
seconds, a considerable milkiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Nitrate of silver does not occasion any
immediate change; but, after standing several
minutes, an effect is just perceptible.</p>

<p>Lime water does not disturb the transparency
of the water.</p>
</div>

<p>From this examination the conclusion
follows, that it is a water containing a very
minute quantity of solid ingredient. In one
thousand parts the specific gravity is only
<a id="tn_108">2/10</a> higher than that of distilled water.
From the nitrate of silver causing so slight
a change, we see that the water is almost
free from the muriates. It is evident that
the chief solid ingredients are the sulphate
and the carbonate of lime. Although I
should certainly consider that a water still
less impregnated with these salts, and especially
the sulphate of lime, would be more
wholesome, yet, when the small proportion
existing in this water is estimated, I am led
to the conclusion, that the disorder of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
digestive organs, which commonly happens
to the visitors of Paris, is not attributable
to the water of the Seine, but to the new
mode of living, and above all to the free,
and sometimes intemperate, use of the light
acid or acescent wines. In such cases, weak
brandy and water should be substituted, and
if wine be taken, care should always be
observed to procure such as is of the best
quality, and the most free from acid.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Since the printing of the sheets on the
subject of the stethoscope, I have met with
many interesting and important cases, proving
to my further and complete satisfaction
the value of the indications afforded by the
instrument.</p>

<p>In reverting to the subject, I shall offer
a concise account of two instances in which
I derived an accuracy of instruction for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
treatment, which I could not otherwise have
obtained.</p>

<p>A lady fifty years of age, who enjoyed
good health generally, and was not subject to
cough, had been ill with symptoms of pneumonia
and bronchitis, a week before I was
consulted. I found the following symptoms:
the pulse frequent, hard, and rather full;
the skin hot; cheeks flushed; the tongue
much furred; the urine high-coloured, not
depositing sediment; the bowels torpid;
cough rather occasional than constant, but for
the most part violent; the expectoration copious
and muco-puriform. In the upper parts of
the right and left sides of the chest, the indications
afforded by the stethoscope were, very
sharp and strong sounds, both in inspiration
and expiration, conjoined with the mucous
rattle. She did not experience any pain,
nor any sensible difficulty of respiration,
although it was evident that she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
breathe naturally; and fits of coughing
were easily excited. Her countenance had
a very feverish and anxious look. Previously
to my visit she had been bled only
once.</p>

<p>I directed a free bleeding from the arm
in the morning, and the application of
twenty leeches over the chest in the evening.
I prescribed small doses of tartar emetic, in a
saline draught, every four hours; some calomel,
James’s powder, colocynth, and extract
of poppy at bed time, with a saline aperient
in the morning, and other general means.
The blood was extremely cupped, with a
dense buffy coat. The bleeding from the
arm was twice repeated in the course of the
three following days; and as the sounds
were still indicated by the stethoscope, although
in a less degree, the leeches were
again applied twice in the course of the week;
the medicines being regularly administered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
By these means the pulse became reduced
from one hundred and twenty to ninety, and
acquired a degree of softness. When the
heat of skin abated, a blister was applied on
the chest; but it appeared to have the effect
of creating more febrile irritation; and
without affording relief to the cough. I
have observed this disadvantage to follow
from blistering in other cases of an inflamed
and irritable state of the lungs; and I apprehend
that we should, under such circumstances,
take into consideration whether or
not this peculiar stimulus may produce more
injury than benefit, from the irritation which
it creates in the chest being more influential
than the counter-action produced on the
surface.</p>

<p>The tartar emetic proved very decidedly
useful in its effects. I did not increase the
dose beyond three grains in the twenty-four
hours, and in the commencement of its use,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the smaller doses occasioned much sickness;
but with the advantage of removing
morbid secretions. The cough becoming
very irritable, syrup of poppy was added
to the saline antimonial draught; and,
when all necessity for bleeding was removed,
the infusion of digitalis, in small
doses, was also employed; for, in this case,
inflammatory action prevailed to a most
troublesome degree. Indeed, the complaint
became chronic, the fever decidedly hectic,
and the situation of the patient appeared
to be precarious. The expectoration had
strongly a puriform appearance, was streaked
with blood, and was very copious: its
odour was faint, but not particularly offensive.
The sounds which I have mentioned
became less acute, and the rattle was more
mucous. At this period I directed the use
of tartar emetic ointment over the chest,
which produced an extensive pustular eruption;
and the advantage of this counterirritation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
was very marked. I have the
pleasure of adding that this patient is now
most favourably convalescent. She is taking
with advantage, as a mild restorative
medicine, an infusion of the cortical part of
sarsaparilla in lime water, mixed with an
equal portion of milk made hot.</p>

<p>The other case was that of a young
woman, affected with many of the same
symptoms which I have related in the foregoing
case, but in a more acute degree.
From accidental circumstances timely treatment
had been omitted; and I found the
highest degree of general fever, with a
pulse frequent, hard, and obstructed. The
breathing was laborious, but not attended
with any fixed pain in the chest. Her
voice was rather hoarse, and had lost
its natural tones. The cough was urgent,
and the expectoration took place with difficulty.
The expectorated matter was, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the most part, frothy, and had a remarkably
acid odour. The cheeks were flushed
with a deep hue of purplish red, and
the lips assumed a very dark appearance.
Such was the laboured state of the circulation,
that the patient was affected with an
almost constant disposition to faint. She
complained of a sense of extreme burning,
and also of soreness, over the whole of the
chest. She had not enjoyed any sleep for
three nights, nor any in the day; her mind
was occasionally delirious; and her countenance
wore the greatest anxiety.</p>

<p>In the upper part of the right side of
the chest, I discovered by the stethoscope
remarkably acute sounds, both in inspiration
and expiration, and in the left side
similar sounds, but in a weaker degree. I
also distinguished the mucous rattle in some
points. Blood was taken freely from the
arm, and it was cupped and buffy in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
extreme. Sixteen leeches of full size were
applied to the right side, and eight to the
left side of the chest. Tartar emetic was
administered internally in the manner I
have before mentioned. The altered and
improved situation of the patient in a few
hours, was equally remarkable and satisfactory.
All the urgent symptoms were
alleviated, but all continued sufficiently
troublesome to require a repetition of general
and local bleeding, in the course of
the three following days. It is worthy of
remark, that free depletion removed the
disposition to faint. At the end of eight
days, the symptoms of active inflammation
were removed, and at the same period
the sounds had ceased, and the stethoscope
afforded only the indication of the
mucous rattle. The tartar emetic solution,
although joined with the syrup of poppy,
caused more than usual sickness in this
case; but it appeared highly beneficial, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
useful instruction in regard to the seat, the
removing more freely, than the simple act
of expectoration could accomplish, the viscid
matter, which, latterly, was muco-puriform,
and was less acid in odour. After
the reduction of the inflammation, pulv.
ipecac. compos. was given in a saline
draught at night, with great advantage in
assisting sleep and allaying cough.</p>

<p>This patient is convalescent and takes
the mild medicine of sarsaparilla with hot
milk, just now described, in conjunction
with the draught at night, and gentle aperients
occasionally.</p>

<p>I think I have here shewn, that by
means of the stethoscope,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I obtained much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
extent, and the progress of the inflammatory
symptoms; and that I was thereby
enabled to direct my local treatment with
greater accuracy and advantage, than I
could have done, if confined to the ordinary
modes of investigation.</p>

<p>The cases which I have here related, correspond
with Laennec’s description of acute
pulmonary catarrh, or bronchitis, a term
which I have been accustomed to consider,
more applicable to the inflammation affecting
the larger branches of the bronchia
proceeding immediately from the trachea.
When the ramifications extending through
the lung are inflamed, it constitutes a case,
either mixed with, or, so much resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
genuine <a id="tn_119">pneumonia</a> or inflammation of the
substance of the lungs, that, in a practical
point of view, the distinction does not perhaps
appear important; but yet, accuracy
of diagnosis should always be desired.</p>

<p>In the case of a young gentleman lately
under my care, the symptoms of inflammation
in the lungs were acute, of considerable
continuance, and apparently distinct
from any affection of the bronchia, as
the stethoscope did not afford the sonorous
rattle, but only the crepitating and mucous
kinds. I do not speak of this as a solitary
example which has occurred to me. At this
moment I am attending an elderly gentleman
severely ill with pneumonia; and, in
examining his chest, I cannot discover the
sonorous rattle except in one small point;
but I meet with other phenomena, as the
crepitating rattle in one part, and the indication
of obstruction of the air cells in
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>I take this occasion to observe, that in
my study of the volumes of Laennec and
Forbes, I do not discover so much mention
as my experience would have led me to expect,
of the strong sonorous rattle, or sharp
tones (which in their variety admit of almost
endless comparisons), as being characteristic
of the existence of more or less active
inflammation of the bronchia. I have found
this species of rattle serve, in a remarkable
manner, to point out the exact seat of the
inflammatory action; and in proof that I
have not been drawn into false conclusions
from these particular indications of the
stethoscope, I have been successful in my
treatment, and have ceased to perceive the
tones, in the same proportion as the inflammation
has passed away.</p>

<p>Laennec, when speaking of the sonorous
rattle, observes, “I am led by my dissections
to believe that it is produced by the
partial obstruction or narrowing of part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the tract of a bronchial tube, whether this
takes place from the pressure of a tumour,
or of a portion of the lung condensed by
inflammation, or by the obstruction produced
by a portion of tenacious mucus, or
by the partial thickening of the internal
coat of a bronchial ramification.”</p>

<p>The absence of the respiratory sound
may arise from an impermeable state of
the cells, or the bronchial ramifications, and
have for its cause the presence of tubercles,
or other matter of obstruction; or it may
proceed from some secretion or effusion,
the produce of disease. But the student,
when he does not discover any sound of
respiration, must be careful to avoid drawing
false conclusions from his yet imperfect
tact in the art; it so commonly happens,
that calm respiration does not afford
any distinct perceptions to the unpractised
ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>It appears to me worthy of consideration,
whether or not, in some states of hydrothorax,
the evacuation of the fluid by
puncture may be a desirable expedient?
The increased accuracy of diagnosis attainable
by means of the stethoscope, would
here be very important towards deciding
the fit period for the performance of the
operation.</p>

<p>In the narration of my cases, I have
not made mention of percussion. Suffice
it to observe, that I have seldom used it
except in chronic diseases of the chest, as
the indications by the stethoscope, in addition
to the general symptoms, have afforded
me all the information which I have required.</p>

<p>I shall here bring my Observations to a
conclusion, having endeavoured to present
in a concise and intelligible form, a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the results of my own experience in the use
of the stethoscope; and to consider briefly
the merit of some points of practice; inquiring
at the same time into the nature
of several medicines, which claim our particular
attention, both from their novelty
and their importance.</p>

<p>The value of any practical opinion must
be decided by the suffrages of the many;
but, whoever collects and records his facts
with care and fidelity, renders some contribution
to the advancement of the medical
art.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I am inclined to think, that during the inflammatory
diathesis, a larger proportion of fibrin than natural is actually
formed in the assimilating process; and it is further probable
that it is not distributed as usual to the several fibrous textures
of the body. In my Essay on the Blood, I have suggested
this last hypothesis.</p>

powers of the stethoscope in enabling the surgeon to detect
with greater nicety the fractures of bones. I have read these

I conceive that cases may occur of each description, in which
the aid of the stethoscope would be found not unimportant.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> I am happy to state, that an institution similar in principle
to the <i lang="fr">Maison Royale de Santé</i>, is established in London.
It is called the <cite>Asylum for the Recovery of Health</cite>. It is situated
in Lisson Grove. Already it has been highly patronised,
and well does it deserve to grow in the favour of
the public. It is supported in part by voluntary contributions,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The use of white mustard is at present very popular,
and, like all popular remedies, is employed too indiscriminately.
Its medicinal power is not a new discovery. Cullen,
in his Materia Medica, vol. ii, p 171, observes, “As much of
the unbruised seeds as an ordinary table-spoon will contain
does not prove heating to the stomach, but stimulates the intestinal
canal, and commonly proves laxative.” Entirely with
a view to determine the nature of this article as a medicine, I
made an examination of the seeds in their whole state. In a
few days after being digested in cold water, they became much enlarged,
and the water had powerfully the smell of sulphuretted
hydrogen. Submitted to distillation in a common alembic
with water, the portions of the liquid which first came over possessed
the taste of a weak infusion of malt, quite free from
pungency. Digested in alcohol, they did not communicate
strongly either smell or taste. Some seeds which had passed
the alimentary canal, were found to be much swollen, and had
lost some of their pungency. It is evident from these results,
that the seeds, by treatment with these agents, were acted
upon with difficulty in their entire state.</p>

<p>In the Journal de Chemie Médicale, de Pharmacie, &amp;c.
No. X. Année 1<sup>re</sup>. M. M. Henry fils et Gorot, have given an
elaborate report of their chemical examination of the mustard
seed, of which the following is the substance: the seeds yield
by expression a fixed and a volatile oil, and the latter may be
separated from the former by digestion in alcohol. The alcoholic
solution when evaporated affords a solid and crystallisable
substance, possessing acid properties, to which the discoverers
have given the name of sulpho-sinapic acid. Sulphur,
it is stated, forms a constituent element of this peculiar acid.</p>

<p>M. Julia Fontenelle, in the same <a id="tn_57">Journal</a> (No. 3), informs
us, that from his researches he is led to conclude, that the mustard
seed owes all its medicinal powers to the volatile oil, for
the extraction of which he recommends that the seeds should
be reduced to powder, and distilled with eight or ten parts of
water.</p>

<p>It may be considered therefore that the properties of the
seeds become sufficiently extracted in the stomach and intestinal
canal, to excite the mucous membrane to increased secretion,
and also to influence the action of the nerves. They are
found principally useful to those invalids who suffer from general
deficiency of secretion in the intestinal canal, and from nervous
langour. I do not conceive that they are so proper for
persons of the inflammatory diathesis, and who become easily
heated; and I should rather approve of them as an occasional
than a constant remedy, for they are not a certain aperient,
and I do not think it desirable to subject the canal constantly
to this kind of stimulus. If the seeds accumulate very much,
some inconvenience may be occasioned by their augmentation
of bulk, and if they be retained in the intestines, some further
inconvenience may result from the disengagement of sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> M. Goupil, who was attached to the Hospital of Val-de-Grâce

in a work entitled Exposition des Principes de la
Nouvelle Doctrine Médicale, &amp;c. Paris, 1824.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> With regard to many other medicines, the most useful
maximum of dose is an interesting question. I am certain
that the largest quantity which the stomach will receive, is
not the most efficacious. The action between the medicine
and the stomach must be mutual. If we take, for example, so
innocent a medicine as the carbonate of iron, I expect more
effect from the dose of a dram than half an ounce, which would
incommode the powers of the stomach by its mass. The observation
applies to all medicines which are of a very insoluble
nature. I do not mean, in a general sense, that a small dose
of a medicine has equal power with a large one, but that
there is a point of increase, beyond which the efficacy becomes
lessened.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Sulphate of quinine may be procured by digesting bruised
bark in repeated portions of diluted sulphuric acid, until the
liquor no longer possess a bitter taste. The different liquors
are then to be mixed together and strained. To the strained
liquid, lime is to be added, until the mixture assume a chocolate
brown appearance, and a precipitate subside to the bottom
of the vessel. This precipitate must be washed with a
little cold water, dried, and digested in alcohol. The alcoholic
solution, when submitted to distillation, leaves, in the
retort, a brown viscous liquid, which is to be treated with a
suitable quantity of boiling dilute sulphuric acid and a portion
of charcoal. This solution is lastly to be filtered, and set
aside to cool, when crystals of the sulphate of quinine will
form. Mr. Garden informs me, that the largest portion of
the sulphate of quinine which he has been able to prepare
from the best yellow bark, is as one to fifty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Opium is to be digested in cold water, and the solution
filtered. Pure ammonia is to be added to this liquid so long
as a precipitate is produced. Impure morphine is thus
obtained, which may be purified by dissolving it in acetic
acid, and digesting it with animal charcoal. The solution
is again decomposed by ammonia. This precipitate is to be
washed with distilled water, and dissolved in boiling alcohol,
from which pure morphine will crystallise upon cooling. The
acetate is formed by dissolving the morphine in dilute acetic
acid, and evaporating the solution to dryness upon a sand
bath.</p>

We may refer the discovery of the prussic acid to
the labours of Scheele, and that of morphine to Sertunner;
from which last discovery, we may consider that the idea of
insulating the most important principles of other vegetable
medicines took its rise.</p>
